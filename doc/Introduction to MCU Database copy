# Introduction to MCU Database

> MCU Database for Pisces IDE is coded with a specific desciptional language. This document will introduce the way of coding database to you.

## [] label
MCU Database file is splited with [] label.

[occupier] means option descriptions for peripherals follow

[resource] means descriptions for resources occupied by peripherals follow, these will hint for conflicts among mutex peripherals.

[label] means descriptions for translator follow.

## namespace
Namespace describes a set of peripherals. Usually, you should create a namespace for each MCU to include periperal descriptions on it. Format:

```
NameOfNamespace{
    Descriptions for Peripherals...
}
```

Pisces IDE retains a default namespace called *std*, in order to plug MCU descritions into standard hardware abstraction layer(Standard HAL).

## std namespace
Pisces standard library configures code with names and options in std namespace, which alias for custom peripheral namespaces. These peripheral namespaces should implement std options


**Oh fucking Engish too troublesome, I'll compile it later.**
